# CodeGen Demo

This project is a very simple iOS app aimed to demonstrate the benefits of using Code Generation in Swift, especially using [SwiftGen](https://github.com/SwiftGen/swiftgen) and [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery).

It's used in my talks about Code Generation, SwiftGen & Sourcery.
